## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Adding New Categories

To add a new ticket category:

```python
from ticket_classifier import TicketCategory

new_category = TicketCategory(
    name="category_name",
    description="Clear description",
    keywords=["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    patterns=[
        r"regex.*pattern1",
        r"regex.*pattern2"
    ],
    priority="high|medium|low",
    auto_resolvable=True|False
)
```

Add it to `ticket_classifier/categories.py` in the `DEFAULT_CATEGORIES` list.

### Testing New Patterns

Test your patterns before submitting:

```python
import re
text = "your test ticket text"
pattern = r"your.*pattern"
if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):
    print("Match!")
```

### Improving Classification Accuracy

When improving patterns:
1. Test with real-world ticket examples
2. Check for false positives and false negatives
3. Balance pattern specificity vs coverage
4. Document why changes improve accuracy

## Areas Where We Need Help

- **More categories:** Healthcare, retail, education-specific categories
- **Better patterns:** Improve regex patterns for existing categories
- **Language support:** Non-English ticket classification
- **LLM providers:** Support for more LLM providers
- **Integrations:** Examples for more ticketing systems
- **Documentation:** Tutorials, guides, and examples
- **Testing:** More comprehensive test suite

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
3. The PR will be merged once you have approval from a maintainer
